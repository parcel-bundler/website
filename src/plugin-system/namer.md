summary: "A plugin type: Generates an output-filepath for a bundle"
---

Namers accept a bundle and output a filepath for that bundle (the resulting path should be relative to `rootDir`).

```js
import { Namer } from "@parcel/plugin";

export default new Namer({
  async name({ bundle, bundleGraph, logger, options }) {
    if (bundle.filePath != null) {
      return bundle.filePath;
    }

    let name = yourNamingFunction(bundle);
    if (!bundle.isEntry) {
      name += "." + bundle.hashReference;
    }
    return name + "." + bundle.type;
  },
});
```

{% error %}
You have to make sure that the bundle filepaths are unique.
{% enderror %}

Namers have complete freedom over the filepaths, but they should still follow these rules:

- Return `bundle.filePath` if it's set, to make sure that the output file set in `package.json#targets` is respected.
- If `bundle.isEntry` is true, don't include [the hash in the filename](#Including-a-hash).

## Including a hash

If you want to include a hash in the filename that is based on the final bundle contents, insert `bundle.hashReference`. This is an opaque value that will later on be replaced with the actual hash (since at this stage, there is no bundle content to generate the hash of).
