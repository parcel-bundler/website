## Installing the Parcel CLI

The Parcel CLI is built into the main `parcel` package.

While you can install and run Parcel globally, it is much better to install it locally into your project as a dev dependency. To do this navigate to the project in the terminal and run the install command listed below.

To install Parcel, run the following command:

```bash
yarn add -D parcel@next
```

Or when using NPM run:

```bash
npm install -D parcel@next
```

## Setting up the Project

### Example Project

To make running parcel easier, you should add some `scripts` to your `package.json`, these are a kind of shortcut to a usually longer command. Below we're gonna suggest some minimal Parcel commands to get you started.

Common names for these scripts are `start` for starting the development environment and `build` for building a production version of your application. We will be using these naming conventions in the example below.

To run the development environment in this example you can run `yarn run start` or `npm run start`.

To create a production build in this example you can run `yarn run build` or `npm run build`.

{% sample %}
{% samplefile "package.json" %}

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel serve ./src/index.html",
    "build": "parcel build ./src/index.html"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "next"
  }
}
```

{% endsamplefile %}
{% samplefile "src/index.html" %}

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My Parcel Project</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="./index.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

{% endsamplefile %}
{% samplefile "src/index.tsx" %}

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";

render(<h1>Hello World</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));
```

{% endsamplefile %}
{% endsample %}

### Parcel commands explained

In the above example you can see two commands, the development command `parcel serve ./src/index.html` and `parcel build ./src/index.html` for creating production builds.

Note that the commands in the example have `./src/index.html` as an entry point instead of a JavaScript file, which is different from other bundlers. Using a HTML file as the entrypoint makes Parcel easier to use as it will be able to detect dependencies directly from the HTML file and bundle all these detected dependencies into their respective bundles automatically without any configuration. Parcel can even do more advanced things automatically like differential serving and compiling inline scripts and styles without any configuration.

#### Development command

The development command `parcel serve ./src/index.html` starts up a development server for serving your JS, HTML, CSS files and any other assets of your project.

Besides the hosting of these assets, we also start a [Hot Module Reload](/features/hmr/) server which is a websocket that listens to build events and reloads a script, style or your entire page depending on what changed (if you are using React, we even have [React Fast Refresh](</recipes/react/#hmr-(fast-refresh)>) built in). This is super useful as you no longer have to wait for the build to complete and manually refresh the page, although you can still do this if you want by adding the `--no-hmr` flag to the command.

It also ensures all used libraries and frameworks are built in development mode, meaning you will get additional debug information if they provide any. Parcel sets the `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable to `development`, generates source maps and doesn't do any minification.

#### Production build command

The production build command `parcel build ./src/index.html` does exactly what it says it does, which is building your application.

It creates production-ready bundles that contain very little to no unused and development code, ensuring your end-user gets fast load times. We achieve this by telling frameworks and libraries we're building for production by setting the `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable to `production`.

We also run a minifier over most assets to ensure code is as minimal as it can and do [scope hoisting](/features/scope-hoisting/) on all the JavaScript bundles to ensure as little unused code as possible ends up in the JavaScript bundles.

These bundles are also named in such a way that any non-html assets can be cached safely by a CDN for a very long time without any user ever having an incorrect or outdated bundle as the name includes a hash of the final bundle content.

## Browserslist

By default Parcel uses the following browserslist config: [`> 0.25%`](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E+0.25%25) this will be a good default for most applications.

### Why configure browserslist

Having a custom browserslist ensures you are in full control of which browsers your application supports, for example you need to support IE 11, than you can define: [`> 0.25%, ie 11`](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E0.25%25%2C+ie+11). This will ensure IE 11 will always work regardless of the market percentage it will have in the future.

On the other side it is also useful for reducing bundle size as supporting a lot and outdated browsers results in a lot of polyfills, for example if you don't need to support IE 11 or Opera Mini you can use [`> 0.25%, not ie 11, not op_mini all`](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E+0.25%25%2C+not+ie+11%2C+not+op_mini+all) which should in turn reduce bundle size, which results in faster load times and happy users/customers.

### How to configure browserslist

To configure a browserslist you can take a couple approaches, you can define it in your `package.json` file under the `browserslist` key or in a seperate configuration file: `browserslist` or `.browserslistrc`.

You can find more information over in the [Browserslist repo](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#readme)

In our configuration section, we explain how you can set [targets](/getting-started/configuration/#targets) for configuring Parcel.

## Differential Serving

Parcel also supports differential serving, which means you can serve a different bundle to modern browsers as you do to old browsers. This results in faster load time for newer browsers as the bundle size will be a lot smaller.

You don't have to add any config to make this work, the only thing you have to do is add a script tag to your HTML file. Parcel automatically takes care of the browserslist target by implicitly removing all browsers from your (defined) browserslist that do not support esmodules.

To utilise this, you need to have two script tags in your HTML file: one with `type="module"` and one for older browsers with the `nomodule` attribute.

You can find an example of such a html file below.

{% sample %}
{% samplefile "src/index.html" %}

```html/11,13
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Differential Serving Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <!-- This script tag will get a reference to the bundle with targetting your defined browser target -->
    <script nomodule src="./index.tsx"></script>
    <!-- This script tag will get a reference to the esmodule bundle -->
    <script type="module" src="./index.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

{% samplefile "src/index.tsx" %}

import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";

render(<h1>Hello World</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));
```

{% samplefile "package.json" %}
