[Web Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/) are a set of APIs for building browser extensions that work across many browsers. Parcel supports building Web Extensions using `@parcel/config-webextension`.

## Getting started

First, install `@parcel/config-webextension` into your project:

```shell
yarn add @parcel/config-webextension --dev
```

Next, you'll need a [manifest.json](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json) file, which will be the entry point of your extension. See [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/) for details on how to set it up.

To build your extension, run Parcel using your `manifest.json` as an entry, and `@parcel/config-webextension` as the config:

```shell
parcel build manifest.json --config @parcel/config-webextension
```

You can also create a `.parcelrc` file in your project extending `@parcel/config-webextension`. This way you don't need to pass the `--config` option to the Parcel CLI every time.

{% sample %}
{% samplefile ".parcelrc" %}

```json
{
  "extends": "@parcel/config-webextension"
}
```

{% endsamplefile %}
{% endsample %}

## HMR

For the best experience, you'll also want to enable a few options:

- `sourceMap#inline` and `sourceMap#inlineSources`: Source maps don't work unless inlined in web extensions
- `--host localhost`: Needed for HMR to work properly in content scripts

To do this, create two [targets](/features/targets/) in your `package.json`: one for development with inline source maps enabled, and one for production without. Then, create some scripts to start the development server and build for production.

{% sample %}
{% samplefile "package.json" %}

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "webext-dev": {
      "sourceMap": {
        "inline": true,
        "inlineSources": true
      }
    },
    "webext-prod": {}
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel src/manifest.json --host localhost --target webext-dev --config @parcel/config-webextension",
    "build": "parcel build src/manifest.json --target webext-prod --config @parcel/config-webextension"
  }
}
```

{% endsamplefile %}
{% endsample %}

Running `yarn start` or `npm start` will start the development server. HMR and source maps will work for background scripts, content scripts, the popup page, and the options page. To add the extension to your browser, research how to load an extension unpacked (for example, in Chrome, [click "Load Unpacked"](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest)).

Running `yarn run build` or `npm run build` will give you the final web extension package, ready to be published. After zipping the output directory, you should be able to upload your file to your platform of choice, such as the Chrome Web Store.

## Special Considerations

### Unexpected messages

In development mode, your background scripts will receive a message event with the content `{ __parcel_hmr_reload__: true }` whenever the page is reloaded. Parcel will use this automatically to refresh the extension when necessary, so you'll want to ensure any messages your background scripts receive do not have the `__parcel_hmr_reload__` property before handling them.

### Styling

One unfortunate consequence of using web extensions is that importing style files from content scripts will not work properly. This may be revisited in the future, but for now you'll need to include whatever stylesheets you use in the [`css` property in `manifest.json`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/content_scripts#css).

### Asset URLs

Asset URLs will not have the extension prefix added, so trying to use assets such as images by [importing them with the `url:` pipeline](</configuration/plugin-configuration#predefined-(offical)-named-pipelines>) in content scripts will fail. However, when add the assets you need to the [`web_accessible_resources` key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/web_accessible_resources) (which is necessary anyway to use them in content scripts), the filepaths will remain the same as during build time. With that in mind, you can just do:
{% sample %}
{% samplefile "content_script.js" %}

```js
// If you have a file images/example.png and you've either added that image
// or a glob that matches that image to web_accessible_resources:
const assetURL = browser.runtime.getURL("images/example.png");
// Now this image loads
document.getElementById("myImage").href = assetURL;
```

{% endsamplefile %}
{% endsample %}

Note that if you're only supporting Chrome, you should use `chrome.runtime.getURL`.
