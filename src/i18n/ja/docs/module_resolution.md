# ðŸ“” Module Resolution

The Parcel resolver implements a modified version of [the node_modules resolution](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together) algorithm.

## Module resolution

In addition to the standard algorithm, all [asset types supported by Parcel](https://parceljs.org/assets.html) are also resolved.

Module resolution can be relative to the:

- **entry root**: the directory of the entrypoint specified to Parcel, or the shared root (common parent directory) when multiple entrypoints are specified.
- **package root**: the directory of the nearest module root in `node_modules`.

### Absolute Paths

`/foo` resolves `foo` relative to the **entry root**.

### ~ Tilde Paths

`~/foo` resolves `foo` relative to the nearest **package root** or, if not found, the **entry root**.

### Glob file paths

Globs are wildcard imports that bundle multiple assets at once. Globs can match some or all files (`/assets/*.png`), as well as files in multiple directories (`/assets/**/*`);

This example bundles a directory of png files and returns the dist URLs.

```
import foo from "/assets/*.png";
// {
//   'file-1': '/file-1.8e73c985.png',
//   'file-2': '/file-1.8e73c985.png'
// }
```

### package.json `browser` field

If a package includes a [package.browser field](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#browser), Parcel will use this instead of the package.main entry.

### Aliases

Aliases are supported through the `alias` field in `package.json`.

This example aliases `react` to `preact` and some local custom module that is not in `node_modules`.

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "some-package",
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.7.0"
  },
  "alias": {
    "react": "preact-compat",
    "react-dom": "preact-compat",
    "local-module": "./custom/modules"
  }
}
```

Avoid using any special characters in your aliases as some may be used by Parcel and others by 3rd party tools or extensions. For example:

- `~` used by Parcel to resolve [tilde paths](#~-tilde-paths).
- `@` used by npm to resolve npm organisations.

We advise being explicit when defining your aliases, so please **specify file extensions**, otherwise Parcel will need to guess. See [JavaScript Named Exports](#javascript-named-exports) for an example of this.

## Common issues

### JavaScript Named Exports

Alias mappings apply to many asset types and do not specifically support mapping of JavaScript named exports. If you wish to map JS named exports you can do this:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "some-package",
  "alias": {
    "ipcRenderer": "./electron-ipc.js" // specify file extension
  }
}
```

and re-export the named export within the aliased file:

```js
// electron-ipc.js
module.exports = require('electron').ipcRenderer
```

### Flow with Absolute or Tilde Resolution

When using absolute path or tilde path module resolution you must configure Flow using the [module.name_mapper](https://flow.org/en/docs/config/options/#toc-module-name-mapper-regex-string) feature.

Given a project with this structure:

```
package.json
.flowconfig
src/
  index.html
  index.js
  components/
    apple.js
    banana.js
```

And `src/index.html` as an entrypoint, our **entry root** is the `src/` folder.

Therefore, to map this import correctly:

```javascript
// index.js
import Apple from '/components/apple'
```

We need Flow to replace the leading `/` in `'/components/apple'` with `src/`, resulting in `'src/components/apple'`.

The following setting in our `.flowconfig` achieves this replacement:

```
[options]
module.name_mapper='^\/\(.*\)$' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/src/\1'
```

Where `<PROJECT_ROOT>` is a Flow specific identifier indicating the location of our `.flowconfig`

NB: `module.name_mapper` can have multiple entries. This allows support for [Absolute](module_resolution.html#absolute-paths) or [Tilde](module_resolution.html#~-tilde-paths) Path Resolution in addition to [local module aliasing](module_resolution.html#aliasing) support.

### TypeScript ~ Resolution

TypeScript will need to know about your use of the `~` module resolution or alias mappings. Please refer to the [TypeScript Module Resolution docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html) for further information.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Monorepo Resolution

These are the advised usages with monorepos at this time:

Advised usage:

- use relative paths.
- use `/` for a root path if a root is required.

Unadvised usage:

- **avoid** `~` use within monorepos.

If you're a monorepo user and would like to contribute to these recommendations, please provide example repos when opening issues to support the discussion.
