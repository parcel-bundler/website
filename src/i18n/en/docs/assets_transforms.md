# üì¶ Assets & Transforms

## üì¶ Assets

Parcel is based around assets. An asset can represent any file, but Parcel has special support for certain types of assets like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files. Parcel automatically analyzes the dependencies referenced in these files and includes them in the output bundle. Assets of similar types are grouped together into the same output bundle. If you import an asset of a different type (for example, if you imported a CSS file from JS), it starts a child bundle and leaves a reference to it in the parent. This will be illustrated in the following sections.

<sub>\* Documentation can sometimes get out of date, for the current supported asset types see [parcel/src/Parser.js](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/blob/28df546a2249b6aac1e529dd629f506ba6b0a4bb/src/Parser.js#L10). For the actual list of Parsers see [parcel/src/assets/](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/tree/master/src/assets).</sub>

For any asset type not supported by default you can check if a plugin already exists:

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/packages?q=parcel-plugin-&p=1)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=parcel-plugin-)
- [awesome-parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/awesome-parcel#plugins)

or [create your own](https://parceljs.org/plugins.html).

## üê† Transforms

While many bundlers require you to install and configure plugins to transform assets, Parcel has support for many common transforms and transpilers built in out of the box. You can transform JavaScript using [Babel](https://babeljs.io), CSS using [PostCSS](http://postcss.org), and HTML using [PostHTML](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml). Parcel automatically runs these transforms when it finds a configuration file (e.g. `.babelrc`, `.postcssrc`) in a module.

This even works in third-party `node_modules`: if a configuration file is published as part of the package, the transform is automatically turned on for that module only. This keeps bundling fast since only modules that need to be transformed are processed. It also means that you don't need to manually configure the transforms to include and exclude certain files, or know how third party code is built in order to use it in your application.
