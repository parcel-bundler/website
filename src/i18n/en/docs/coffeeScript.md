# CoffeeScript

_Supported extensions: `coffee`_

[CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org) is a language that transpiles to JavaScript, which allows you to use a shorter syntax and other features like [the existential operator](https://coffeescript.org/#existential-operator), [shorter array-splicing syntax](https://coffeescript.org/#slices), [block regular expressions](https://coffeescript.org/#regexes) and more.

```coffeescript
# log.coffee
console.log 'Hello there!'
```

```javascript
// index.js
import './log'
```
