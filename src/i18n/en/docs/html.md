# HTML

_Supported extensions: `htm`, `html`_

HTML assets are often the entry file that you provide to Parcel, but can also be referenced by JavaScript files, e.g. to provide links to other pages. URLs to scripts, styles, media, and other HTML files are extracted and compiled as described above. The references are rewritten in the HTML so that they link to the correct output files. All filenames should be relative to the current HTML file.

```html
<html>
<body>
  <!-- reference an image file -->
  <img src="./images/header.png">

  <a href="./other.html">Link to another page</a>

  <!-- import a JavaScript bundle -->
  <script src="./index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Importing uncompiled assets

Adding links to files that Parcel can compile (e.g. JavaScript, TypeScript, SCSS, etc.) in HTML is supported. Parcel will automatically process the file and update the link to point to the compiled asset.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- include a SCSS file -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./my-styles/style.scss">
  </head>
</html>
```

# PostHTML

[PostHTML](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml) is a tool for transforming HTML with plugins. You can configure PostHTML with Parcel by creating a configuration file using one of these names: `.posthtmlrc` (JSON), `.posthtmlrc.js`, or `posthtml.config.js`.

Install plugins in your app:

```bash
yarn add posthtml-img-autosize
```

Then, create a `.posthtmlrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "posthtml-img-autosize": {
      "root": "./images"
    }
  }
}
```

Plugins are specified in the `plugins` object as keys, and options are defined using object values. If there are no options for a plugin, just set it to `true` instead.
