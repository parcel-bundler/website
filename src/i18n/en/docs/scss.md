# SCSS

_Supported extensions: `sass`, `scss`_

SCSS compilation needs `sass` (JS version of `dart-sass`) module. To install it with npm:

```bash
npm install sass
```

Once you have `sass` installed you can import SCSS files from JavaScript files.

```javascript
import './custom.scss';
```

Dependencies in the SCSS files can be used with the `@import` statements.
