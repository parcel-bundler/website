The `parcel` CLI is the most common way to use Parcel. It supports three different commands: `serve`, `watch`, and `build`.

## `parcel [serve] <entries>`

The `serve` command starts a development server, which will automatically rebuild your app as you change files, and supports [hot reloading](/features/development/#hot-reloading). It accepts one or more file paths or globs as [entries](#entries). `serve` is the default command, so it may also be used by passing entries directly to `parcel`.

```bash
parcel src/index.html
```

{% warning %}

**Note**: If you have specified multiple HTML entry points and none of them has the output path `/index.html`, the dev server will respond to `http://localhost:1234/` with a 404, since Parcel doesn't know which HTML bundle is the index.

In this case, load the file directly, e.g. `http://localhost:1234/a.html` and `http://localhost:1234/b.html`.

{% endwarning %}

See [Development](/features/development/) for more details.

## `parcel watch <entries>`

The `watch` command is similar to `serve`, but does not start a dev server (only a HMR server). However, it automatically rebuilds your app as you make changes, and supports [hot reloading](/features/development/#hot-reloading). Use `watch` if you're building a library, a backend, or have your own dev (HTTP) server. See [below](#entries) for how to specify entries.

```bash
parcel watch src/index.html
```

## `parcel build <entries>`

The `build` command performs a single production build and exits. This enables [scope hoisting](/features/scope-hoisting) and other production optimizations by default. See [below](#entries) for how to specify entries.

```bash
parcel build src/index.html
```

See [Production](/features/production/) for more details.

## Entries

All Parcel commands accept one or more entries. Entries may be relative or absolute paths, or globs. They may also be directories containing a `package.json` with a `source` field. If entries are omitted entirely, the `source` field in the `package.json` in the current working directory is used. See [Entries](/features/targets/#entries) in the Targets documentation for more details.

{% warning %}

**Note**: Be sure to wrap globs in single quotes to ensure that they are not resolved by your shell and are passed to Parcel directly. This ensures that Parcel can automatically pick up newly created files matching globs without needing to restart.

{% endwarning %}

```bash
# Single file
parcel src/index.html

# Multiple files
parcel src/a.html src/b.html

# Glob (quotes required)
parcel 'src/*.html'

# Directory with package.json#source
parcel packages/frontend

# Multiple packages with a glob
parcel 'packages/*'

# Current directory with package.json#source
parcel
```

## Parameters

These parameters are supported by all Parcel commands.
