  title: ðŸ”¥ Hot Module Replacement
  order: 4
summary: Refreshing your JS app without a full page reload
---

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) improves the development experience by automatically updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh. This means that application state can be retained as you change small things. Parcel's HMR implementation supports both JavaScript and CSS assets.

By default, Parcel fully refreshes the page when files change. In case you're not using a framework that configures HMR already, you can manually opt into HMR (so reexecuting your JavaScript) by adding the following in your app. This will only apply in development; HMR is automatically disabled when bundling in production mode.

{% sample %}
{% samplefile "index.js" %}

```js
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept();
}
```

{% endsamplefile %}
{% endsample %}

As you save files, Parcel rebuilds what changed and sends an update to any running clients containing the new code. The new code then replaces the old version, and is re-evaluated along with all parents. You can hook into this process using the `module.hot` API, which can notify your code when a module is about to be disposed, or when a new version comes in. For React, this happens automatically (see [React](</recipes/react/#hmr-(fast-refresh)>))

There are two methods to know about: `module.hot.accept` and `module.hot.dispose`. You call `module.hot.accept` with a callback function which is executed when that module or any of its dependencies are updated. `module.hot.dispose` accepts a callback which is called when that module is about to be replaced.

{% sample %}
{% samplefile "index.js" %}

```js
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.dispose(function (data) {
    // module is about to be replaced.be
    // You can save data that should be accessible to the new asset in `data`
    data.updated = Date.now();
  });

  module.hot.accept(function (getParents) {
    let { updated } = module.hot.data;
    // module or one of its dependencies was just updated
  });
}
```

{% endsamplefile %}
{% endsample %}

## File watcher

To support an optimal caching and development experience we've build a very fast watcher in C++ that utilizes built-in low-level watching functionality of each operating system. Using this watcher we watch every single file in your project root (including all node_modules), based on events and metadata from these files we decide whether to rebuild and which files need to be updated/looked at during a cached build.

### Known issues with file watching

#### Safe Write

Some text editors and IDE's have a feature called `safe write` that basically prevents data loss, by taking a copy of the file and renaming it when saved.

When using Hot Module Reload (HMR) this feature blocks the automatic detection of file updates, to disable `safe write` use the options provided below:

- Sublime Text 3: add `atomic_save: "false"` to your user preferences.
- IntelliJ: use search in the preferences to find "safe write" and disable it.
- Vim: add `:set backupcopy=yes` to your settings.
- WebStorm: uncheck `Use "safe write"` in Preferences > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings.
- vis: add `:set savemethod inplace` to your settings.

#### Linux: No space left on device

Depending on the size of your project and configured watching limit, this error might pop up when you're running Parcel on linux, to resolve this issue you have to change the `sysctl` configuration for `fs.inotify` to have a higher value for `max_user_watches`.

You do this by adding or changing the following lines in `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
fs.inotify.max_queued_events = 16384
fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 128
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 16384
```

If this error persists you can try increasing the values even more.

#### Using Dropbox, Google Drive or other cloud storage solutions

It is best practice to not place a Parcel project in a folder that is synced to the cloud using something like Dropbox or Google Drive, as these solutions create a lot of file system events that can mess with our watcher and cause unnecessary rebuilds.

(This functionality is provided by `@parcel/runtime-browser-hmr`.)
